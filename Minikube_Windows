# Installing Minikube on Windows


Let's learn how to install the latest Minikube release on Windows 10 with VirtualBox v6.1 specifically.

NOTE: For other OS, VirtualBox, and Minikube versions, the installation steps may vary! Check the Minikube installation!

Verify the virtualization support on your Windows system (multiple output lines ending with 'Yes' indicate supported virtualization):

PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> systeminfo

Install the VirtualBox hypervisor for 'Windows hosts'
Download and install the .exe package.

NOTE: You may need to disable Hyper-V on your Windows host (if previously installed and used) while running VirtualBox.

Install Minikube
We can download the latest release or a specific release from the Minikube release page. Once downloaded, we need to make sure it is added to our PATH.

There are two .exe packages available to download for Windows found under a Minikube release:

minikube-windows-amd64.exe which requires to be added to the PATH: manually
minikube-installer.exe which automatically adds the executable to the PATH. 
Let's download and install the latest minikube-installer.exe package. 

Start Minikube
We can start Minikube using the minikube start command, that bootstraps a single-node cluster with the latest stable Kubernetes version release. For a specific Kubernetes version the --kubernetes-version option can be sued as such minikube start --kubernetes-version v1.19.0 (where latest is default and acceptable version value, and stable is also acceptable). Open the PowerShell using the Run as Administrator option and execute the following command:

PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> minikube start
